# Game-Logic
## Clone as "Game-Logic" - open inside vscode Dev Container: Java & PostgreSQL with Springboot (Maven) dependencies.

``` sh
cd /Logic
```
## Looks like...
``` sh
vscode âžœ /workspaces/Game-Logic/Logic (main) $
```
## Package as a jar using maven...
``` sh
mvn package
```

## Look for "[INFO] Building jar: /workspaces/Game-Logic/Logic/target/Logic-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"

``` sh
  java -jar /workspaces/Game-Logic/Logic/target/Logic-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
